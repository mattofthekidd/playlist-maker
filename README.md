DOI Decisions:
 -Watch training on .net core and ef core. We decided that getting a walkthrough of the basics would be beneficial.
 -Rebuild current authorization services. We are using the "Authorization code flow" https://developer.spotify.com/documentation/web-api/tutorials/code-flow
 -We are going to let the front-end handle initial auth and we'll send the user token to the back-end to be saved.
